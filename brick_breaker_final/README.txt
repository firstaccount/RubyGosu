HOW TO PLAY
- You have 3 lives
- If you don't catch the ball with the bar, it disappears off of the bottom of the screen. You lose 1 life every time this happens.
- When you run out of lives, you lose. 
- If you break all of the bricks in 3 lives, you win the game. 

Things to do for next time:

1. Change angle the ball bounces off at
	Right now it is always 45 degrees
2. When the game ends, display end message
	If win, ...
	If lose, ...
3. Create README with instructions
4. Make ball crack when hit first time, deletes second time.
5. Make different levels
6. Display scores
	Make each brick worth different points?
7. Add more images to background?
